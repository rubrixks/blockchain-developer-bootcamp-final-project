To reduce common attack vectors, I implemented proper uses of require, used the most updated version of solidity,0.8.11, and using msg.sender instead of tx.origin. I also protected against an integer overflow attack by making the Max total supply of The Game Nfts to 2^256-1 because I do not know the maximum limit on how often the human race will think about the game in the species lifetime.
