#The Game

**Concept:**

Im sorry to whoever is reviewing this final project, for I have made you lose The Game.
If you do not know the rules, or if this is your first time hearing of this, here is the wikipedia link for reference.

This project is focusing on the meme'ers of the internet, but there is no intention of over promising.
The use case is simple. If anyone in the world thinks of The Game, instead of posting their L on reddit or twitter,
the individual can mint the Lost NFT for .00001 Ether.
Why blockchain technology? This is now the best way to record and announce to the world that someone has lost The Game for generations to come.
It would be difficult to search through social medias and other sites to determine how many people have lost. 
By having a decentralized immutable ledger, anyone in the world can see and count what addresses have lost The Game.

**Work Flow:**

	1.Users will visit the website and be first be shown a description of what The Game is, and why this was made. 
	2.The website will detect a wallet, and ask to connect the wallet to the website.
	3.If the user is the creator of the contract, they can begin the game and mint 10 Losses. If the user is not the creator, they can mint as many losses as they wish
	4.Either user must send the amount requested to mint the Losses onto their wallet.
	5.Users can then check how many people have lost The Game and how many losses their account has.
